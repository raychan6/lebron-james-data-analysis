# Lebron James: The New Michael Jordan

## Question: Can we find any interesting insights from analyzing LeBron James's stats (2003-2022)?

### The PDF file walks through our methods and findings. Below is a summary:

- Historically, LeBron's plus/minus is highest against Charlotte and behind the most against Denver
- LeBron's TS% has essentially always been above 50% but was highest when he was in Miami at age 28 (66.5%). Even at age 37, his TS% was 61.8%, which is higher than much of his younger years. 
- Game Score stat drops after playing 43 minutes in home games for Cleveland and 37 minutes in home games for Los Angeles. For Miami, there seems to be no significant difference in Game Score across minutes played or location.
- Caveats: missing values were omitted, some insightful stats including PER were not analyzed
